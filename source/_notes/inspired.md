**10 Biggest Problems with Waterfall**

1. The source of ideas. Stakeholder's aren't the best source of ideas.
2. Business cases imply you can know the right solution and how much it'll cost. (Often wrong on both counts.)
3. Product roadmaps don't work for two reasons: 1) Half of the ideas we try simply won't work out and 2) The promising ideas typically require several iterations to deliver the right business value.
4. Waterfall defaults the role of the product manager to gather and document requirements for engineers.
5. Design is implemented far too late in the game, resulting in "lipstick on a pig."
6. Engineering gets introduced to the problem way too late. "If you're just getting engineers to code, you're only getting about half their value."
7. Agile principles aren't applied until far too late — only affecting _delivery._
8. The entire process is _project-centric_ rather than solving for _business outcomes_.
9. Customer validation is pushed until the end (way too late!)
10. Missed opportunity cost of what the team _should_ have been building instead.

**3 Principles of Empowered Product Teams**

1. Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end.
2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.
3. It's all about solving problems, not implementing features.

**Product discovery answers 4 critical questions:**

1. Will the user buy this (or choose to use it?)
2. Can the user figure out how to use this?
3. Can our engineers build this?
4. Can our stakeholders support this?

**What is a Prototype?**

A prototype is not something that's ready for prime time. Not something your team would try to sell and stand behind. Instead it's optimized for fast, cheap learning. Strong teams test 10-20 experiments per week using prototypes.

**Prototype vs. MVP**

The MVP should be a prototype, not a product. A product means your customers can run their business on what you release, sell & support. Building a fully baked product to learn is a huge waste — even if it's simple.
