Does the idea of "networking" make you uneasy? Good news: It doesn't have to!

There's a more authentic way to grow your career faster and give back to the community. I call it building a 3-Circle Network and it's helped me land my dream job at a software startup and "randomly" get a YouTube video with 20,000+ views.

There's no shortcut. It's all fueled by personal growth, intentional outreach, documenting key learnings, and giving back unselfishly.
