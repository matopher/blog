# 👋 Hey There, This is My Personal Site. 
My name's Matt Woods and I'm a marketer + developer at [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindapp.com/) in Oklahoma.

Since you ventured out this far — why not [reach out?](https://mattwoods.io/contact/) I'd love to chat.

## Development Notes
Jigsaw's build command won't compile while you're editing a file that belongs to a collection. Make sure to exit individual markdown files before build.
