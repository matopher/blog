## Topics We'll Cover:

- What's the Bullseye Process and why's it different than the alternatives?
- What are the 3 traction and phases and where do most people typically get tripped up?
- What channels are you the MOST biased toward (positively and negatively) and why?
- Why is it so hard to split your time 50/50 between marketing and building (and who's doing this well?)
