😳 Absolutely unreal...

My recent talk on "How I Landed My Dream Software Job in 12 Months" was picked up by a super popular YouTube channel with 500K+ subscribers!

More than 8,000 views in a few days and I've gotten to help aspiring coders from India, Sweden, Bangladesh, Indonesia & more.

I hope it's useful to anyone who wants to level-up their coding skills. 🙏🏻
