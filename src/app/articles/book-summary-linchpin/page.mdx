### The Cult Of Done Manifesto
Bre Pettis and Kio Stark

> There are three states of being.
> Not knowing, action and completion.
> Accept that everything is a draft.
> It helps to get done.
> There is no editing stage.
> Pretending you know what you’re doing
> is almost the same as knowing what you
> are doing, so just accept that you know
> what you’re doing even if you don’t
> and do it.
> Banish procrastination. If you wait more
> than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
> The point of being done is not to finish but
> to get other things done.
> Once you’re done you can throw it away.
> Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
> you from being done.
> People without dirty hands are wrong.
> Doing something makes you right.
> Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
> Destruction is a variant of done.
> If you have an idea and publish it on the
> internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
> Done is the engine of more.

> P. 184 - scarcity creates value, and what's scarce is a desire to accept what is and then work to change it for the better, not deny that it exists.
