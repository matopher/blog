## Check out the books, podcasts, tools & software I've recommended most often.

True story: I kept finding myself recommending cool stuff to my friends, but...

I'd always have to fumble around to find the links and forget, etc. etc. üôÑ

**This handy list solves that problem!** I hope you find something useful that makes your life better in some small way.

I use affiliate links for Amazon products so I can buy more cool stuff to review. Hopefully that's cool with you. ü§ôüèª
